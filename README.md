# Tetris
Build Tetris app


The logic of the application:
The game plays on a grid of 20 rows and 10 column. However, we need 2 extra row at the top to handle the spawning of the blocks. so the grid will be 22 rows and 10 column. The 2 extra top grid will have hidden property, so it won't be visible in the real gameplay.




 The values 0 and 1 used in IsRowFull, IsEmpty, ClearRow, and MoveRowDown should be defined as constants or enums to improve code readability.
